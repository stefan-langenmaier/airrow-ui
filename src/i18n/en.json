Since then, 4 to 5 international artists* come every year from the 14 countries of the Danube region and develop project ideas, which can be realized one year later in the public space in Regensburg.",

After giving access to your location, you will be guided via GPS to the locations of temporary interventions. Once you have reached your destination, you can use the app to virtually bring back to life the artworks that have already been restored. Depending on the location, the menu shows one or more different 3D installations in AR layers."
